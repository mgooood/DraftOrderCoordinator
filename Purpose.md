# Fantasy Football Draft Order Picker

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Every fantasy football season starts the same way: a chaotic email thread trying to determine draft order.

### Before This App:
```
Email Thread: "Draft Order Selection 2024" (47 unread messages)
├── Mike: "I want position 1"
├── Sarah: "I'll take 3"  
├── Mike: "Actually, can I change to 4?"
├── Dave: "What positions are left?"
├── Sarah: "Wait, I thought I said 2, not 3"
├── Jessica: "Can someone summarize what's been picked?"
├── Commissioner: "Can everyone just reply with ONE position?"
├── Tommy: "I'm confused, what's available?"
└── [39 more confusing emails with reply-all chaos]
```

**Result**: Frustrated commissioner, confused league members, and wasted time.

## ✅ What This App Does

**Simple Purpose**: Replace the messy email thread with a clean, organized way to select draft order positions.

### After This App:
```
Clean Dashboard View:
Position 1: Mike ✓
Position 2: Sarah ✓  
Position 3: Jessica ✓
Position 4: [Your turn, Don!] ← Magic link brings you here
Position 5: [Available]
Position 6-12: [Waiting for selection...]

Status: 3 of 12 coaches have selected their positions
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Commissioner sets up**: Enters last season's standings
2. **Automated emails**: System emails coaches in priority order (worst finish picks first)
3. **Magic link selection**: Each coach clicks their personalized link to select their preferred draft position
4. **Real-time updates**: Everyone can see current draft order status
5. **Final result**: Clean draft order ready for ESPN/Yahoo/Sleeper import

## 🎪 What This App Is NOT

- ❌ **Not a player drafting tool** - No players are selected here
- ❌ **Not a league management system** - Just handles draft order
- ❌ **Not a season-long platform** - Used once per year, before draft day

## 🏆 Success Criteria

**The app succeeds when**:
- Zero "reply all" emails about draft order
- All 12 coaches know their exact draft position
- Commissioner can focus on draft day logistics instead of email management
- 5 minutes of setup replaces hours of email coordination

## 🎯 Target User

**Primary**: Fantasy football commissioners tired of email chaos
**Secondary**: League members who want a simple, clear way to pick their draft spot
